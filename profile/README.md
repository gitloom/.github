## About

Your GitHub commits tell a story. But nobody can read it.

"I'm DONE writing status reports when I could be shipping code instead."
-- a passionate GitLoom.ai customer

GitLoom breaks down your development activity into what actually matters: What's moving fast, what's getting stuck, and what's driving real value.

**Stop sending reports like this:**
- ❌ "Fixed authentication bug, updated dependencies, refactored user service"
- ❌ "Merged 8 PRs this week, working on API improvements"
- ❌ "Sprint goals on track, addressing technical debt"

**Start showing impact like this:**
- ✅ Moving Fast: Payment integration completed and deployed
- ✅ Getting Stuck: Mobile release waiting on third-party API fix
- ✅ High Value: New user dashboard with improved navigation ready for testing

**Game-changer for:**
- 🚀 Agencies → Clients see exactly where their budget creates value
- 🚀 Product teams → Leadership spots blockers before they become disasters
- 🚀 Startups → Investors understand progress beyond "we're coding hard"

We help you extract actionable insights from GitHub that you would actually care about.
